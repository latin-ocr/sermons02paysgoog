ue to gratily them. And this, in lact, is the source
ol' all the unbeliel which prevails iu the world3 for
tbe evidence attending God’s word, is so convin-
cing, tlrat men never would, never could disbo-
beve, did they not first wish to dishelieve it.-But,
to proceed‚ God’s threatenings being thus disbeliev·
ed, and the lies os the tempter embraced as truth,
every harrier, which opposed her progress, was re-
moved3 andthe sinlul propensities, that have been
mentioned, brohe out into open, actual disobedi-
ence. She toolr os the huit ol the tree and did
eat. Thus she made a sull entrance into that way,
which wichad men have ever since trodden. The
first step was sellishuess3 the second, pride; the
third, sensuality3 the fourth, unbeliel 3 and the
last, actual, open, willul disobedience. To the
same result every one will come, who begins to
troad in her steps. Selfithnesa pride, and sensu-
ality‚ will lead them in pursuit'oi forbidden objecta
up to the gnte which opposes their progress in the
broad way3 a gete, which is secured by God’s aw-
sul threatenings. Unbeliel, by disregarding these
threatenings, will draw back the bolts, and then
actual disobedieuce will burst open the gate, and
huny them onward, without restraint, in the broad
way. And as the first rinner was unwilling to walh
in this way alone, and became a temptet, hy pre·
senting tha fatal fruit to her husband, and persua-
ding him to eat ς so all, who have since walked iu
it, have wished sor companions‚ and enticed their
relatives, friends, and acquaintances to sollow them.
