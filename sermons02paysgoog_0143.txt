Ι thests, murders, aod adulteries. Ο Jerusalem, says

J ehovah, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou ·

mayest be saved. How long shall vain thoughts
lodge within thee? Let the uurighteous man sor·

sake his thoughts. The thoughts os the wicked are
au abomination. Hear, Ο earth, Ι will bring evil

“ upon this people, even the sruit ol their thoughts.

Even men’s characters are determinod by their
thoughts and purposes; lor as a man thiuketh iu
his beart, sois he. These passages are more than
sufficient to prove, that there may be much sin
committed in thought And il vain, soolish thoughts
are sinful, who, who, my hearers, ean enumerate
his sius? Who cau even number the sins of this
kind, os which he isguilty iu a single day? And
many ol these thoughts are rendered peculiarly
sinsul by being indulged in the house ol God, du·
ring the hours set apert sor devotion, when, if ev·
er, the mind ought to be solemn and, collected:

But itis here impossible to descend to particulare. ἱ

We must leave every one to reflect, as he pleases,
on the atheistical thoughts, the impious and pro-
sane thoughts, the impure, eovetnus, vain, soolish,
aud absurd thoughts, which heve passed through
his mind, audheen entertained there. And while
you reflect ou this, remember, that thoughts are
the language of disembodied spirits3 that thoughts

“ are words in the ear ol God3 and that our guilt,

in his sight, is uo less great thau is we had actually

given utterauce to every thought, which has lodg-
ed in our miuds. Agreeebly, we findour Saviour
