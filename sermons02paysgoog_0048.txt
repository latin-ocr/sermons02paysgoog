beginning. Ata single glauce he looks through
stemity and immensity, and takes into view, at
, once, the whole circle of existence. That this

ι perfect knowledge must cause his thoughts and
, ways to be infinitely above ours, it is needless to
remark. Are not the thoughts and ways oi man

above those of the brute? Are not the thoughts
and ways os the parent above the comprehension
os bis new born insant? Do not our own change,
as we increase in wisdom and knowledge? How
far, then, must the thoughts and ways os tbe om-
niscient, insaliible God exoeed those os ignorant,
short sighted and sallible men.

Farther. God is infinitely above us in power.
We are weak and frail to a proverb3 and our
plane, ways, enterprizes, must conform to the
weakness of our powers. But God is all-power·
sul; with him nothing is impossible. Hs can do

v numberless things, ot which we can form¹ no con-

ception, and he can do what he does in an incon-
oeivable variety of ways. This consideration alone,
were there nothing else, would prove that his

thoughts and ways are sar above ours.
Again. God is eternsl and unchangeable, while ⁶

‚ we ara but ol yesterday, and die, perhapS, tomor-

row, and are continually changing, as our situation
and circumstances change. Sur‘ely the thoughts
and ways os such creaturos cannot be suitoble or
proper sor a being, who had no beginning, who
cannot change, but is, yesterday, today, and lor·

ever, the εαωοὲ
