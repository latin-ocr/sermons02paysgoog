things indeed to the ewahened sinner, none who
have suffered thus need betold3 and such are the

all conquering Prince gird on his resistless sword 3
array himself in glory and majesty3 ascend the
chariot os his gospel, display the banner of his
oross, and ride forth, as on the wings of the vvind,
while the tremendons voice ot' a herald proclairned
before him, Ppppere ye the way of the Lord3
