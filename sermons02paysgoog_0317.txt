he was less and less affected hy worldly objeote,
,and more und more insensible to their influence.
So you were once deod with respect to your Creo-
tor, your Redeemer, to religione, to divine things,
end to all the concerno ot' your ererlusting pesce.
ln other words, you were entirely insensiblo to
these things3 they did not effect yon, they uredo
no impression upon your mindo, eny more then il
they did not exist, end, in fect, you did not et oll

animale in the pleesures os sense. Yon possessed
whot mey be callodretionul, or intelleetnel life, by
which yon were quelified to meintein intercourse
und communion with your retionnl sellow creaturos
in the pursnit end enjoyrnent of worldly objectu.
But of thet spiritual lile, which renders' the sonl
snsceptible ol impressione from spiritual objecto,
end preperes it lor tlre enjoyment os intercourse
with God ond holy beinge, you were entirely desti·
tute. Boing thus spirituelly dead, you were, of
course, devoid ol spiritual eonses. Yon could nei·
ther-hear, nor see, nor leel. Yon could not henr
God’s voice, either in his word, or in the dispense-
tions of hir providence. He spoke once, yos, twice,
but you perceired it not; nor did you ever trnly
hear esingle sermon, though yon might, perhaps,
listen to meny. You were also spirituslly blind.
Yon sew no glory in God, no benuty in Christ, no
hotefnlnese insin, no excellency in the plen of sel·
