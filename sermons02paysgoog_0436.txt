nomenonii. 429

Who oen wonder thet God hstes-who cen relrnin
lrorn haring—the destroyer ol so much good, the
oense of so much evil! Were it not sorsin, we
should observo this day in n manner ns holy und ss
happy, as hus now been described. We heve the
sorno powers und suculties which were possessed
hy our first parents in Peredise. And il we moy be·
lievc the declaratione os scripture, or the testimony
of good men, God's glory still shines es brightly
in his uotis, ns ‘n did then. There is nothing
but our own sinfulness to prevent un from seeing
it ss clearly, us it wns seen hy our first parents,
und from being affected hy the sight us they were
affected.

But to return-lt such is the manner, in which
innocent creatores would keep n least unto the
Lord, then such is the manner in which we should
aim to keep this sunuel festival. We should desire
end eim to exercise the seme seelings‚' to worship
God with thesemo sincerity, servency, und unity
ol affection, end to converse und pertale ol his
bonnty in the smne manner. l do not ssy weshnll
perlectly suoceed in such an attempt, hut l do say
thur we ought to melre it. He who does not mulce
it, he who does not desire end aim to serve God with
his whole heert, end leel dissutisficd with himself in

proportion us he comes slrort ol it, is ns lar from
Christian sincerity‚ os he is from sinless perlection.

But though we all ought to be persectly holy, it
is buttoo evident thet we ere not so. We heve nll
sinned3 we still sin3 we mostell heve perished in
