appear exoeedingly sinlul. Thus it is evident, that
the consciousness ol sin committed and guill con·
tracted must render the government, and all the
perfectioris ol God, objects ol terror and anxiety
to the sinner3 and, ol course, the recollection ol

them must to him be painsul.
Nor is this all. Every sinner loves sin. He

places his whole delight in it The only happiness,
with which he is acquainted, consiste in gratilying
either the desines os the llesh, the desires ol the
eye, or the pride ol life. But all these things are
s contrary to the will ol God. He sorbids the sin·
nerto pursue them; he lorbids him to indulge or
gratily his sinlul propensities3 he commende him
' to mortily and destroy them, to deny himself, to
take up his cross, follow Christ, and live a rehgious ·
x lise, in which sinners con find no pleasure. He not
only requires all this, but threatens all, who do not
comply‚ with everlasting punishment. Whenever,
therefore, the sinner thinks os God, he thinks ol a
being, who crosses all his darhng inclinatione,
thwerts all his schemas os happiness, and tresde
down self, that idol which he loves to worship, and
“ to which ho wishes every thing to give way. The
sinner, therefore, cannot but loolr upon God, when
he views him in histrus character, as his greatest
and most irreconcilable enemy. Agreeahly, heis
represented by the inspired writers as saying in his
heart, No God3 thetis, would thero were no God,
or that l could escape from or resist his power.
