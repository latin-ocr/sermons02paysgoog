thy course towards me, plantone os thy sharp, hut ·
salutary arrows in my flinty heart, that l may sall
under thee, and become one of thy people in this
day os thy power. And let those, who already
scel his arrows in their hearts, heware how they
endeavor to extract them, or permit any hand to
do it hut his own. To those, who will apply to no
other physician, he will in due time return to heal
their wodnds, and speok peace to their conscien-
ces. But remember the time is short. Soon will
the Saviour he gone, and then he that isunjust,
must remain unjust still, and he thetis filthy, must
he filthy still. Now, ina peculiar manner, is the
accepted time, and day of salvation. A'nd we, my
Christian friends, how shall we receive our Prince
and Savionr, should he visit this place? What
shall we, what can we render to him, who has re-
memhered us in our low estate, and returned to
visitur with his salvation? , What indeed, hut that
⁰ offering, which he prizes above all othere, ahroken
and contrite heart? Bring to him such a heart.
Shew him the scara, which his arrows os love lor·
merly made init. Remind him and yourselves ol
the memorahle time, when hc come to heal the
wonnd, and speak peace to your consciences.
Let every henrt which he has thus wounded and
healed, prepare him room. Let every voice, which
he has tuned to join in the hallelujahs of heaven,
he now heard celebrating his perfectione, and pray-
ing sor his speedy and universal triumph.
