Pence end saletyt then sudden destruction coin-

eth upon thern. And who can doubt that such a
sight, bursting in such armuner upon rnen immers-
edin worldly cares end pleasures, or engaged in

congregation would be distracted with guilty seer
and remorse; and thet ell sinnors, in all parts os
the world, would bo affected in a similar manner?
Some os you heve scen into what wild alerm, what
temporary distraction, en assembly may be throwu ι

alive in the world, that this sight will prove terri-

. blo. All the sinlul dead, whose bodies cre in the
gravo, will then be roused3 sor all thet are in their ·

graves shall heer the voice os the Son of men,
