224 , surarum insunuans

O then, let all, who share in Paul’s salvadeu, imi·
tate iu this respect the example os Paul. .

lt. This subject may asnist us to understand that
memorahle declaration os Christ, From him that ·
hath not shall he taken away even that, which he
seemcth to have. We have seen, that every thing,

· which appears to he naturally good and amiable in

sinuers, such as parental and filial affection, syrn-
⁸ pathy or compassus, and a sweet natural temper,
Ι belongs to the animal soul. Now this dies with
the body. Nothing survives daath, but the immor·
tal spirit. Of course, at death, sinuare, who have
no grace, uo real goodness, will lose all thia appar-
ent goodness, all those natural affectione, which
made them appear amiable here3 and nothing will
remain, but espirit wholly given up to the power
and rage ol malignant passione. Thus lrom those,
who have no grace, no real goodness or holiness,

' will be taken away all which they now appear to

have. O then, be persuaded, ye, who now appear
amiahle, to ecel, most earnestly to seek the sauc-
tisying grace os God. This alona can render your
apparent goodness real, and cause it to he perma-
nent. This alone can stemp on your sauls that
image of God, which consisteth in knowledge,
righteousness‚ and true holiness, and without
which no man shall ever see the Lord.

To conclude-het me urge all, who profess to
be the disciples os Christ, to aim at universal and
complete sanctification, even to be sanctified
throughout in spirit, in soul, and in body. Re·
