ol created light is seen. But a new light now
begins to dawn and brighten upon us. lt is the
light of heaven, which pours in a flood os glory
from its wide open gates, spreading continual me·
ridian day, sar and wide through the regions ol
’ etherial space. Passing ewistly onward through
this flood os day, the songs of heaven begin to burst
’ upon your ears, and voices of celestial sweotness, ·
yet loud ss the eound of many wetere and of
mighty thundcrings, are heard exclaiming, Alleluia!
sor the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Blessing,
and glory‚ and honor, and power, be unto Him
that sitteth on the throne, and to tho Lamb, forev-
er. A moment more, and you have passed the

gates, you are in the midst of the city, you are
¹ heloro the eternal throne, you are in the immedi-
ate presence ol God, and all his glories are blaz-
ing around you like a consuming fire. Flesh and
hlood cannot support it ; your bodies dissolve into
their original dust, but your immortal souls remain,
and stand naked spirits before the great Father ol
spirits. Nor, in losing their tenemento os clay,
have they lost the powers os perception. No: they
are now all eye, all ear, nor can you close the eyelids ·
ol the soul, to shut out, sor amoment‚ the dazzling,
overpowering splendore, which surround you, and
which appear like light condensed, like glory which
may he felt. You see, indeed, no sorm or shape;
and yet your whole souls perceive, with intuitive
clearness aud certainty, the immediate, awo-inspir-
ing presence os Jehovah. You sce no connte·
