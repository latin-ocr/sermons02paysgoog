in nothing do they differ more widely, than in the
asumma which they form os man’s moral charac-
ter, and os the malignity aud desert ol sin. Noth-
ing oan he more evideut than tho lact, that, in the
sight of God, our, sins are incomparably more nu·
merous, aggravated, and criminul, than they ap·
pear to us. He regards us as deserving os en end-
less punishment, while we scarcely perceive, that
we desorve any punishment at all. Now whence
arisae thie difference? The remarks, which have
just beon made will insonn us. God aud meu view
objecta through every different medium, aml are
placed with respect to tlrem in very different situa-
tions. God ir present with every object, he news
it as near, and therefore sees its real magnitude.
But many objecta, especially those ot a religione
nature, are seen hy ns et a distance, and, ol course,
appear to us smaller than they really are. God
sees every objectio a persectly clear light3 hut we
ses most objecta dimly and indistinctly. ln fine,

' God sees all objectu just as they are3 hut we see

mem throughadeceitsul medium, which ignorance,
prejudiee and sels love plaoe between them and us.

Apply these remarks to the case before us. The
Psahniet, addressing God, says, Thou host set our
iniquities before thee, our secret sint in the light
ol thy courtenance. That is, our iniquities or
open nansgressions, and our secret sius, the sins

Ι of our hearts, aro placed, as it were, full before
. God's lace, immediately under his eye3 and he

seco them in the pure, clear, all-disclosing light
