any one can chooee to go away nnpnrdoned, rather
than comply with thane terma3 and yet it ie hut too
prohahle, that many will do it. Whatie still worse,
itis hut too probahle, that some will take encour-
agemont from the Saviour’e mercy to dclay repen·
tance, and repeat their trespaaeea with hopes of
irnpunity. But ii any ere tempted to do this, let '
them recollect, that our Sarionr cannot regniatc
hir conduct by the rnle before us, at hia oecond
coming. At hio first appearing, he came, notae a
jndge‚ bnt aa aSaviour; and it was proper that,
in thie character, he should display unbounded
readiness to forgive. But at hia second appenning,
he will come, not as a Savionr, bnt aa a jndge;
and in that character, he will he constrained to
proceed according to the atrict rulea os justice.
Thone therefore, ”who now rescae rnercy, will then
have judgtnent without mercy. O, then, aeck the
Lo‘rd, while he may be sound; call ye upon him,
while he is near. Kisa the Son,'leat hc be angry,
and yeaperieh frorn the way, and einh to that· world,
where the anund os pardon will never break in
1 upon the waihnga os despair.
