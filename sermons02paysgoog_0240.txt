prayed just before his crucifixion. Father, said he,

me where l arn, that they may behold my glory.
He cannot then be entirely satisfied, till this prayer
is answered in its full extent, till every one whom
the Fatber has given him is brought home to glo
ry. At the period, to which we refer, and not till
then, will thisbe done. The last redeemed sinner
will then have erchanged earth scr heaven, and
have begun to gaze with rapture cn the unveiled
gloriosos his Redeemer.

finally-Cur Saviour will then see the great
work, for the accomplishmcnt of which he died,
completed. He will see that spiritual edifice, the
foundation of which was laid in his blood. which
¹ has been so long erechng, standing before him fin-
ished, resplendent in ¹glory, and perfect in beauty.
Says an apostle, Christ loved the church, and
gave himself for it, that be might sanctify and
oleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
that he might present it to himself a glorious
hhurch, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing3 but that it should be holy, and without
blemish. The church which Christ thur loved, and
for which he gave himself, is called his body. All
who compose it are styled his members. Now un·
til the last member of this mystical body is·reised
to heaven, and fixed in ite destined place, the body
itself will not be perfect and complete, and, of
course, Christ its head wdl not be satisfied. But

when that isppne, his satisfaction will bo complete.
