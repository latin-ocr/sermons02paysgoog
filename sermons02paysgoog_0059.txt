appears unreasonable or mysterious to us, it cer-
tainlyis so, and, therefore, cannot proceed from
God.

bove oure, it must be abominable pride, impiety,
solly and presumption inus to censure them even
in thought Yet how often men do this! How of·
ten do they, at least in their hearts, find lault· with
God’s word, murmur at his dispensatione, repine
under affiictions, seel dissatisfied with his manner
ol governing the world, quarrel with his sovereign-
ty in the bestowing ol lavore, and thus in effect say,
that God is either unwise, unhind, or unjust, and
that they could‘conduct things in a better manner!
My friends, if this is not horridly impious and pre-
sumptuous, is it does not discover the most abomi-
nable pride, what does? For an illiterate peasant
to censure the conductos his prince, with the rea-
sons ol which hc is utterly unacquainted3 for a
child of a week old to condemn the proceedings of
' his parcnt, would be nothing to this. We are told,
that, il any man judgeth a matter before hc hear-
eth ih itis folly and shame unto him. What lolly
and shame is it then to us to attempt to judge ol
GOd’S ⁰01¹de when we know only so small apert
0s his ways, and know even thir part but very im-
periectly. An ancient writer tells us of a man,

who, having a house lor sale, carried a briclr to
market to erhibit as a specimen. You may, per·

haps, smile at his folly in supposing that any pur·

phasor would or could judge ola whole house,
