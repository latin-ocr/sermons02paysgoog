'l'nnns are two objects‚ which a speaker who
addresses his lellow-beings on sn occasion like the

¹ present, ought ever to keep in view. Os these oh

jects, the first, and, with respect to his hearers, the
most important, is, to induce thern to prize es it
deserves, a volume, which, notwithstanding its un·
rivalled claime to attention, istoo generally neg·
lected. The second is, to procare their assistance,
in gratuitously distributing this volume ernong their
destitute follow-creaturos. These objects‚ though
distinct, ere intimately connected, for is we can
be induced suitebly to prise the Secred Scriptures
ourselves, there will be little difficulty in persuad-
ing us to eid, in communiceting them to others,
audoene is bnt too rnuch reason lor presuming,

· that he, who is not desirons to impert this treasure

to all aronnd him, lrnows nothing os its real velue,

nor ol the temper which it is designed to produce. ’
