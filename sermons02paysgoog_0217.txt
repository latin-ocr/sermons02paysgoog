nothing mornlly good, and there is much thatismor-
ally wrong, in their parental affection. Hence itis ,
aridem, that the affection os the animal soul needs
. to he sanctified‚ or brought under the controlling
inlluence ol religion. lt must he sanctified, or we
cannot be universally holy. And srom the pre·

' ceding remarks it will he easy to learn in what this

sanctification consiste, end what vvill be its effecte.

lt is sanctified‚ when it is prompted hy right motivas, ’

when it takes a right direction, end when it is kept
in due subordination to thc will os God. When
thisis done, we shall love our children as God’s
gista, and sor his sake. We shall prefer him to
them. We shall leel ready to resign them, when ·
he callet ond is he takes them away, our sorrow
for their loss will heve no mixture os repining or
discontent. While they are spared to ns, we shall
make it oar chief concern to educate them sor God
and heaven ς their sonls will receive a much meat·
er share of our attention than their bodies; we
shall be lar more anxious for their eternal‚ than
their temporat wollare3 and to secure it, will bathe
principal objectos all our exortions respecting
thern. Those‚ whose affection for their children is
not thus regulated and directed, may be oenain,
thot it is not yet sanctified, thot it is einlul in the
sight ol God, and that they are very sar from being -
such parents, os he approves. And yet they may
feel very well satisfied with themselves3 they may
regam thenmelves as petterns ol parentnl goodneu,
aad even hope that God will reward them as such.
