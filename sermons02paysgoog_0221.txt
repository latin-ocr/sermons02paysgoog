Ἴ in some degree, at least, in vain shall we pretend
to belong to the mereilul, who shall obtainmercy
of God, or claim any relation to our Saviour; sor

is any man have not the spirit os Christ, he is none
os his. And is there is any thing in the spirit ol
Christ, by which ho was peculiarly distinguished,
it was compassion sor the souls of men.

There are two other marks, by which we may
be assisted in ascertaining how far our natural
sympathies are sanctified. Merely natural sympa-
thy usually declines, as men adyanco in years3 so
that, is they live to old age, it becomes almost
extinct. But when it is sanctified, it not only con-
tinues, but increases in proportion to the christian’s
religione advancement. ln this case it is tmly
beautiful to see the affectionate sensibility ol youth
united with tho experience, firmasse, and mature
wisdom of age3 to sec the veteran disciple, who
has learned to endure bardness as a good soldier
os Christ, putting on bowels of marcias, tendemess
and gentleness of mind, to see the'same uae adorn-
ed at once with the blossoms ol spring and the
fruita ol autumn. The second markos sanctified

sympathy, is a disposition to participate in the joys, ·

as well as sorrows, os our fellow creaturas. This
the scripturas require. They command not only
to weep with those who weep, but to rejoiee with
those who rejoiee. This command we shall obey,
so lar as our natural affections are sanctified. We
shall make the happiness of others our own. But
merely natural affection will not lead to this. Ort
