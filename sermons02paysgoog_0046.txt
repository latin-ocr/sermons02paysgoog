noun HM· 39

see new suns, new worlds still rising into view.
Consider that all we cnn discover is, perhaps, but
a spech, a single send on the shore, in comparison
with what remains undiscovered3 that all these in-
numerable worlds are probably inhabited by im·
mortal beings, and that God’s plan of government
for this boundless empire must embrace eternity3

-consider these things, and then say, whether

, God’s purposes, thoughts, end ways, must not ne·

ceeserily he high above onrs, as the heavens are
above the earth, or, as his sphere of action exceeds
ours. Must not tha thoughts and ways os a pow-
erfirl earthly monerch be far above those of one of
his subjectu, who is employed in manufacturinga
pin, or cultivating a few acres of ground? Cen
such a subject be competent to judge of his sov-
ereign's designs, or even to comprehend them?
How far then must the thoughts and ways of the
eternal Monarch of heaven, the King of hings,
and Lord of lords, exceed ours; and how little

. able are⁸ we to judge os them, farther than the rev-

elation, which he has been pleased to give, ena·
bles us.

t 2. God’s thoughts and ways must be inlinitely · ’

above ours, because his nature and perfectione
raise him infinitely above us. He isa seli-existent,
independent, all-sufficient, infinite, eternal, pure,
aud perfect intelligence. We are dependent,
finite, imperfect, frail, dying creatures, lettered by
gross, heavy bodies, and exposed to the influence

of innumerable infirmitas, temptatione and preju· Π
