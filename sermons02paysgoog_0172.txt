4. The pride ol the wiched rendere thern un·
willing to 'seelr alter communion with God. The
pro'ud man never wishes to associate with those,
who are above hirn. If be must have superiora„
he wishes to be as lar l'rom thern as possible, that
the sight of their superiority may not mortily his
pride. Hence the remark os proud Caesar, when
passing through en insignificant village-“l would
- rather be the first rnen in this village, than the se·
cond in Rome 3²² a speech, which, though admired
by the proud and ambitione, nearly resembles thet,
which Milton has put into the mouth ol Satan, af·
' ter his sall:

Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.

This is the genuine languege ol pride; and there·

fore tbe proud man shuns the society ol his supe·
riors, and prefers that os his inferiore. He cbooses
to looh down, rather than to look up, because,
when he looks down, his pride is flattercd by seeing
others below him; but when he looks up, it is
mortified. Hence be will not look up to God. He

ehooses rather to hold communion with irrational
animale in the gratificatione ol sense, then to eeelr
l'or sellowship with the greatest and best ol beings,
in the pure, exaltevl, and exquisite pleasures os re·
ligion. Thus clearly does it appear, that it is the
pride os the wicked, whieh renders them unwilling

to seelr alter God.
