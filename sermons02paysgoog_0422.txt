who have any religione feeling, use all the means
in their power to excite similar feelings in tha
haarts of their brethren. Let all beware, how
they forsake the assembling of themselves togeth-
er, es the manner of some is. Remember that it
was a private meeting of 1110 churoh, et which' our
Seviour thus appeared to them. Remember, too,
what Thomas lost by being absent from this 0110
maeting. While all his fellow disciples were filled
with faith, and hope, and love, and joy, he wes
1011101 a time under the power of unbelief and
despondenoy.

But should our Master, notwithstanding our un·
worthiness, ’ condescend to favor us atthis 111110
with his graoious preseuoe; should he come and
stand 111 the midat of us, aud say, Poaee be unto
yon3 what shall we do? My brethren, we need
not tell you what to do. Your own hearts will in-
form you. Erery 0110, to whom 1110 Saviour shall
manifest himself, will feel ready to cast himself at
11111001, to admira, and wonder at, and thank him
1011111 goodness3 he will feel more than 0101 een-
sible of his own unworthiness of such a favor; he
will repent in dust and ashes, end his future life,
like that of the disciples, will evinoe his sincerity,
and be spent in sels-denying, and persevering la-
bors in his Master’s service.
