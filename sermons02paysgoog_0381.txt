that many of the most bold and faithful servants· of
God and opposers ol vice, haue suffered even unto
blood striving against sin. We grant it, but still it
is true, that the markos God was upon them. lt
appeared in those divine consolatione, which raised
thern saraborc suffering, and the sear of death, and
enabled them to rejoioe and glory in tribulation.
Did not Stephon exhibit ¹this mark, when bis mur·
derare saw bis ⁸lace, es it had been the sace os an
angel? Did not Paul and Silas display it, when at
midnight their joy broke forth, in the hearing ol'
their sellow prisonem, in rapturous ascriptione, aud
songs os praise? Did not some ol the‘martyrs dis·
play it, when they exclaimod in the flames, We feel
no more pain, than it reposing on a bad ol rosea?
ll «we now seldom see this markos God set upon
his children, it is only because the lires os persecu·
tion are extinguished, end because such christiana
as Stephon, and Paul, and the martyra, are no
longer to be sound in the cburch.

But however God may sometimes see fit ιο ex·
pose such as truly moum sor the prevalence ol sin,
to sufferinga in this world, he will most certainly
set a markos deliverance upon them in the world

· ιο come. The Sonos God, clothed in the liuen

garments of hia priestly office, has aprinkled them
with his blood, which, like the blood os the passover,
is a signal sor the destroying angel to pass them by.
He has set upon them a mark, not with pen and
ink, but by tho ·Spirit of the living God, by whom
they are scaled to the day ol eternal redemptiou.
