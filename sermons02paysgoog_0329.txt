os your happiness to the sountain‚ and see them all
flowing srorn the great abyss of God’s eternal, sov-

thus loving and saving you, was, as the apostie in·
iorrns us in the verse succeeding our text, that, in
the ages to corne, he might shew the erceeding
riches os his grace in his kindness toward us

my great name’s sake, that it may be glorified
thercby. Not uoto us, then may we in turn repiy,
not unto us, but uoto thy great name alone,0
Lord, be all the glory and all the praise.
