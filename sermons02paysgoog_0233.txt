· Coeno any os us heve seen what angele saw,
when the Son os God lelt the bosom ol his Father,

earth; could we have seen him divesting himself ol

agonizing, end aecursed death-we should natur-

sufficiently powersul to induce such a being to make
sacrifices so great, to encounter sufferings so ex·
quisito! This question an spostle has partially

endured tho cross and despised the shame sor the

the fruits or effecto of his sufferinge and be satis-
fied. In the context we are inlormed what these

fruits will be. He shall justify many, he shall see .

his seed, and the pleasure ol the Lord shall prosper
