which he never saw, by so small apertos it. But
are not we guilty os much greater solly in attempt-
ing to form en opinion os God's conduct srom thet

’ d0m3 to he equal to him in wiedom, knowledge,
power, end goodness; in one word, we ought to be
God curselves3 for none but God is capable os
judging accurately 'ol the conduct os God. Hence,
whenevcr we attempt to y'udge os it, we de, iu es·
sect, set ourselves up es Gods, knowing good end
evil. Well, therefore, may God reply to our vein,
proud, end impious objections, ‘Who is this, thet
derkeueth counsel by words without knowledge?
Gird up now thy loins like c men, end 1 will de·
mand os thee, eud cnswer thou me. Where west
thou, when llcid the foundations of the earth?
declaro, if thou host underrteuding. Heet thou en
arm like God? or const thou thunder with e voice
like him? Wilt thou disonnul my judgment? wilt
thou condem me, that thou mayest he righteous?’
And while God may thus with propriety cddrcss
euch of us, it becomes us to reply with J ob, ‘Be-
hold, 1 em vile; what shell 1 cnswer thee? 1 will
lay my hand upon my mouth. Once heve 1 spok-
en, but 1 will not cnswer3 yee, twice, but lwill
proceed no serther. 1 heve uttered thet 1 under-

stood not, things too wonderful for me, which 1
knew not’
