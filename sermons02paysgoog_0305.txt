eud in assason os temptation fall away. My ccre-
less hearers, is you would know how many are thus
deceived end perish, look atthis church, or at any
ether church es Christ. See how many there are,
who, aster professing te he converted, aud appear—
ing joyful aad zealous sor a time, lose every thing
of religion, except the name, end a little of the out·
ward form. Yet ell these persons had surmouuted
the first two great difficulties mentioned above.

they had been convinced os their sins3 but iu con-
sequence ol that strong propensity which is natural
to all meu, to neglect the gulde provided by God,

, should you be convinced os your sins, still ir is ex·
ceedingly probabis, that, like thern, you would go

’ ehout to establish your own righteeueness, or be

satally-decaived by elalse couversion. ls you think
thie improbable, is you say within yourselves, we
would be more wise and more cautious, it only '
proves, that you arc under the influence ol a seli·

confident spirit, which would infallibly plunge you ’

inte these very sueres.
