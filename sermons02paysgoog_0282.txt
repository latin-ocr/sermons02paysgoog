nonnas eom vorum Ι275

10 this thy day, the things which belong to thy
peuc03 but now they are hid srorn thine eyes!
This passage very clearly intimatos, thet there is a
tirno, when sinuers may know tho things 01 their
peace3 bnt thet, 11 they suffer that time to poss
without improving it, the things 01 their peace will
then be hidden horn them, und their destruction
will he rure. Hence the upostle exhorts us, in the
context, to take warning srorn the sete 01 the Jews,
who hardened their hearts against God's voice, und
thus provolred him to swear in his wuith, thet they
should not enter his rest. Hence, eho, he informs
ns, that now is the accepted time, now is the day
01 salvation3 thus plainly intimating‚ thet to-
morrow the day 01 salvation may be past. 11 then
you, my delaying hearers, horden your heatts to-
day, God may scal thern up in impenetrable hard·
nese to-morrow. 11 you say, 1 will not embrace
theodore 01 salvation to-day, God will say, No
offers 01 selvetion shall be made you tomorrow.
Nor is there small reason to sear this3 for 01 011 the
sins, which men ean commit, perhaps no one is
nrore provoking to God‚ thau that 01 refusing im-
mediately to hear his voice. lt is a direct aad
wilsul aot 01 rebellion against his authority} itis a
sin committed against light and conviction3 itis ¹
resisting and griewing the Holy Spirit; it is cruci·
fying Jesus Christ uiresh3 it ie prectioally seying,

1 know thet 1 must, nt some period 01 1110, become ”

religious. It ir true death may surprise me, or
God may deny his grace, and leave me to perish‚ 11
