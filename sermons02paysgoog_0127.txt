120 auhuman,

hersh and serere in censuring the maduca or oon-
demning the character of your neighbors? Above
all, are you not deficient in the great duty os liber-¹
ality to the poor, and os doing to others, as you
would wish thet they should do to you? ll so, vain
are all your religione duties3 rein your protensione
os love to God. ln vein do you pretend to ohey
the commands of the first table, while you negleet
theseos the senond3 for piety, without morality‚
is even worse than morulity without piety. You
will be found guilty os wanting love to man; and,
consequendy‚ os being destitute os all true love to
God, whatever you may pretend3 sor, says the
apostle‚ he that loveth not his brother, whom he
hath seen, how eeu he love God, whom ha hath
not seen? And again, whoso heth this world’s
goods, and neoth his brother have need, and shut-
teth up his bowels of compassion lrom him, how
dwelleth the love 01 God in him? And, again, is
any man among you seem to bo religione, and bri-
dleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own beart,
that mnn's religion is vein.

V( Perhaps some may bo found, who will say,
notwithstanding these observatione, still our hope
remeius unshaken3 sor we have both piety and
morality. We not only deal justly and love mer-
ey, as it respects our sellow ereatures, but also
welk humbly with our God. We do not make the
performenoe 01 our duties to men en excuse lor
neglecting our duties to God; nor, on the other
hand, do we consider the discharging of our duty
