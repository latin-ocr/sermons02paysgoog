'l'urs question was addressed by Eliphaz to Joh

He was led to ask it by a suspicion, that Joh wne
a hypocrite. He had imbibed the erroneous opin-
ion, that great temporel calamities are inflicted on
none, except the wicked. Hence he inserted from
the unpreeedented afflictione of* Job, that, notwith-
standing all liis professione and sair appearances ot'
piety, he was awicked man. He therefore endea-
vored to convince him that this was his character,
and thet he had been deceived respecting himself.
With this view he addressed him in the language
ol our text: la not thy wickedness great? and
thine iniquities infinite? Had Joh really been
what Eliphaz erroneously supposed him to be, this
would have been a very proper question, and the
charge, which it implies, ‘would have been strictly
just. Itis, therefore, still a proper question to he
proposed to all, who are ignorantes themselves.

lndeed, it may, without impropriety, be addressed ·

to every child ol Adam, since there is notan in·
dividua] among them, who, it he answer it truly,
must not answer it in the affirmative. To estab-
lish this truth-that the sins ol men are infinite in
number and enonnity-is my present design.
