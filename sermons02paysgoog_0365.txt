358 THE nrm

the Lord hath forsaken the earth 3 therefore will l
also deal in iury: mine eye shall not spara, neither
will l have pity, and though they cry witha lond
voice, Ι will not hear. The sulfilment ol thess
threatenings was immediately witnessed by the

prophet in vision, bnt in their execution mercy was
’ mingled with justice. He cried in minc cars, says
the prophet, Caose them that hare charge over the
, city to draw near. And behold six men came from
the way ol* the higher gata, every mon· with a
daughter weapon io his hand, and one man among
them was clothcd with lincn, with a writcr's inlr·
horn by his side. And the Lord said unt'o him,
Go through the midst os the city, and sata mark
upon the foreheuds ol the men that sigh und cry
for ull the abominatione, that arc done in the midst
thereos. And to the others he said, Go ye alter
him through the city and emite. Let not your cyo
sparo, neither bave pity. Slay utterly young and
old, but coms not near any man, upon whom is the
mark. ·
My hearers, St. Paul informs us, that all the ca·
lamitics, which were experienoed by the Jews, hap·
pencd unto them sor ensamples to others, and that
they were written lor our admonition, upon whom
tbe ends ol tbe world are come. lt, therefore, bs·

attention, aud tc compare their character and con·
duct with our own; that we may derive srom it
that instruction, which it is intended to afford 3 and,
especially that wa may leurn what wc bare reason
