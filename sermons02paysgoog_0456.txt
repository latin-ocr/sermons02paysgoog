Jesus Christ is God manifest in the flesh, God and
man united in one person. His glorified body will
be the te'mple, the vehicle, in which God will come
to judgment, aud this vehicle will be visible. of
its appearance we may, perhaps, sorrn sorne idea
from the description given by Daniel and St. John.
1 beheld, says the former, till the thrones were cast
down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose gar·
ment wes white as snow 3-his throne was like the
fiery flame, and his wheels as bumingfire. Ahery
stream issued and came forth from before him3
thousand thousands ministercd unto him, and teu
thousand times ten thousand stood before him.
Similar ere the expressions os St. John. l saw
one, says he, lihe unto the Son ol man, clothed with
ag'arment down to the loot, and girt about the
breast with a golden girdle. Hir head and his
hairs were white as snow; and his eyes were as a
dame os fire; and his feet were like unto fine brass,
as if they bumed in a furnace3 and his voice was
as the sound os many waters, and his countenance
as the sun shiueth in his strength. l need not ro-
mind you, that similar was his appearance on the
mount ol transfiguration, when his humen form as·
sumed, lor a time, some of that glory, which it was
destined to wear after his exaltatior to heaven, a
glory, however, which will be, douhtless, increased

in a degree thetis inconceireble, when he shall
come, not in his own glory only, but in that os his
Father. Os this glory the sublime language ol St.

John is suited tbty give the most exalted conception.
