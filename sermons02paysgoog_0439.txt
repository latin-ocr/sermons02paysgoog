432 Δ suarm nura

speaks nothing except reproach, condearnation, end

terror. The only words, which it has heard srorn
· the mouth of ch, are, Thon shalt surely. dio; and
these therefore are the only words which it will rc-
peat. And when roused by these words, they look
forwerd, it is without hope os marey, it is to death

and tho blackness os darkness, to judgment, and Ι

tiery indignation. Theo they wish in rain that
thoy had never existed, thoy curse, at once, their
existence and ita author, aad feel all those terrihls,
unaccountable amotione, which agitate with more
thau a tempest’s lory, a heart at enruity with God,
uheuerer it ia forced to contemplate its great ene-

Now suppose that these creaturas, in this statut
guilty, wretched, despairing state, are placed uu·
der a dispensation, in which the grace aad marey
oi God are offered them through a Redeemer, aud
that just such a revelation is made to them, as hes
been made to us in the New Testament. Supposs

dispensation, they resolve to observa areligious ses· l

avar. What would he necessary, what would he
impliodintheir keeping itas a seastunto the Lord? ἰ

1 maner, the first thing necessary would evidently
ha a cordiol reconciliaticn to God. Until such a
reconciliation took ploce, they could neither oh-
scrra a religione festival, nor perform auy other re·
¹ ligious duty, in a right and acceptable manner.-
lndaed, they would hasa no disposition tn do it, nor
any os the feelings, which it implica and demands.
