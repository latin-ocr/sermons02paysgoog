ln the second place, the persons who compoeed
this generation, were seusual and earthly minded,
governed by appetites and passione rather than by
reason, conscience and the law os God. This ap-
pears srom the account given us oT their allianccs

and connectione, in forming which they seem to
have regarded nothing but externat appearances,
choosing sor their partners in lile the irreligione,
immoral, and prolana. That this was a distin· -
guishing treit in their character, as well as thet of

,. the Sodomites, who lived some ages aller them,

appears lrom the account given of their conduct
by our Saviour. As it was in the days os Noah,
says he, so shall it be in the day when the Son os
Men is revealed. They ate, they drank, they
bought, they sold, they planted, they builded, they
married and were given in marriage, and kneW, or
considered not, till Noah entered into the ark, and
the flood came and destroyed them all. This, my
hearers, is a most accurate descriptiones worldly
minded, wicked men, os men completely under

the control os their appetites and passione, and re· ·

gardlcss os every thing but the present lise, with
its transitory objects and pursuits. From this ac-
count it also appears, that they were guilty os un·
, belief, impenitence, hardnees ol heert, and a con·
sequent neglect of the day and means ol grace,
and the offere of salvation. To this unbeliel and
'herdness of heart alone ean it be ascribed, thet.
