may have been written.” How well he was qualili-
ed to make this remark, and how much itimplied
in his lips, may be inserted from the lact, that he
was acquainted with twenty-eight differentw lan-

· guages, und with the best works, which had been

published ia most of thern. That a volume, which,
in the opinion os suche mamis thus superior to
all other books united, cannot be eo insipid and
uninleresting a composition, as many seem to im·
agina, it must be needless to remark. That his
praisea though great and unqualified,’are in no
respect unmerited, it would be easy, were it neces·
Ι cury, to prove, by appropriate quotations from the
book which he so highly entole. ¹ But its morality
will be more properly considered in a subsequent
part os this discourse; and its unrivalledeloquence
and sublimity are too obvious, and too generally
acknowledged, to require illustration. lf any im-
agine that he has estimated too highly, the historical
information which this volume contains, wa would
only request them to perusa it with attention, and
particularly to consider the assistance which it
ufforde, in accounting lor many otherwise inexplica-
ble phenomeua, in the natural, political, aud moral
world. Aperson who has never attended to the
subject, will, on recollection, ba surprised ‘to find,
lor how large a proportion ol his knowledge, he is
indebted to this neglected boola* lt is the only
book which satisfactorily accounts, or even pro-

'lt will be recollected, that we here refer to such insormauon only,
at uuinepired men might communicate.
