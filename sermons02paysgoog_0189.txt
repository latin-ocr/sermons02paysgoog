allow, that, if there be any such thing as consola-
tion, it most be drawn lro’rn the contemplationes

God, and of a future stat03 lor itis most certain, s
that neither this world nor its inhabitants ean afford
it. But from the contemplation ol these objecto
the dying sinner con der'ive no consolation. On
the contrary, he must, il ho thinks ol them at all,
think ol them only with anxiety and dread. ll he
thinks ol God, ho can think ol him only as a'being,
whom hc has neglected and offended, whose mer-

with no leelings hut those ol indignation and ab»
horrencc. Evory rememorasse of hirn most be

which heis hastening, and eternity, shronded in
hlackncss and darkness, spreading in boundless ex-
tent beyond it. ll he looks back, he sees homber-

seat, esd threatening there tc find han out ll hs
looks npward, hs sees nothing bot the frowning
eye ol a just and angry God, the gloriosos which

.' search his inmost soul, and wither all his hopes. Ι
