2. From this subject we may leander, if we
would view every object in its true light, and right·
ly estimate its nature and design, we must consider

cross of Christ all eternity has looked forwerd:
to the cross of Christ all eternity will look back.
The cross of Christ was, if Ι may so express it, the
first object which existed in the divine mind; and
with reference to this great object all other objects
were‘created. With reference to the same object
they are still preserved. With reference to the same.
object every event, thet takes place in heaven,
earth and hell, is directed and overruled. Surely‚
then, this object ought to engage our undivided at-
tention. We ought to regard this world merely as
a stage, on which the cross of Christ was to be
erected, and the great drama ol the crucifixion act·
’ ed. We ought to regard all that it contains as on·

ly the soenes and draperies necessary forits exhib· ¹
ition. We ought to regard the celestia} luminaries

= merely as iemps, by the light of which this stupen-

dous spectacle may be beheld. We ought to view
angele, men and devils as subordinate actors on the
stege, and all the commotione and revolutione of
the world as subservient to this' one grand design.
Separate· any part of this creation‚ or any event
that has ever taken place, from its relation to
Christ, and it dwindles into insignificancy. No
sufficient reason can bc assigned for its existence, ,
