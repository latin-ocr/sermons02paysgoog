With respect to a part, and we trust a very con·

' siderable part of the present assembly, the objecu,

which we have mentioned, may be considered as
already attained. There are, we doubt not, many
before us, who entertain a profound veneration for

favor of a book, which not only ufforde them sup·
port and consolation under the troubles of life, but
enables them to contemplate death with pleesure,

“wiso unto salvatiou.” lf all present are of thir
description, our object is obtained3 and further
remarks are needless. But it is presumable‚ that
in every assembly, many are to be found, who,
through inattention to the subject, or from some
other cause, bave formed very inadequate concep·
tions of the worth of this volume 3 and who, conse·
quently, do not feel the infinite importance of put·
tingit into the hands of others. ltis also notorious,
that even among such as profess to venerate the
scriptures, there are nota few, who seem to regard
them as deficient in those qualities‚ which excite
interest and attention. lt may not be improper,
therefore, on an occasion like the present, to make
afew remarks witha design to shew, that while

the scriptures are incalculably ysluable and impor- ‘
tant, viewed es a revelation from heaven3 they are l

also iu a very high degree interesting aud deserv·
