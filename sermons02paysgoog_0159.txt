tahlish this truth, we observa,

l. That the wichad will not seelr aster the knowl-
edge os God. This the scriptures plainly essert
The wicked say unto God, Depart srom us; sor wa
desire not the knowledge of thy ways. lt isalso
evident from tha experience os all ages, that no
careless, unewalreued sinuer, ever used any means,
or mede the smallest endaavors to acquire a lruowl·
edge of God. Our Saviour explicitly declares, that,
all, who seek, shall find. But the wicked do not
lind the knowledge os God3 therefore they never
seek it. They will not study the scripturas with a
view to become acquainted with God. lt is true,
they sometimes read the scriptures; but they read
them either in aformal, careless manner, or to
quiet the remonstrancen of conscience, orto find
arguments in lavor of some salse system os relig·
ion, which may encourage theru in siusul phrasim,
and enable thern to indulge delusive hopes ol su·
ture happiness. They never look into tha Bible

with a sincere desire to find God there; nor study '

it with that humble, docile, childlilre temper, with·
out which it will ever be studied in vain. And
while many thus read the scripturos with improper
riews, or wrong leelings, many also, there is reason
to sear, scarcely read them at all. From weelr tc
week, and lrom year to year, their Bibles lie on thc
ὑ shelf unopened, while they know little more os their
contente than os tho Koran os Mahomet.
