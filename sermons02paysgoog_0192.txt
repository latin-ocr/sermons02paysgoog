gospel os Christ, the gospel of reconciliation!
Were it not sor this, ,the remembrance, and -stilb
more the presence of God, would have occasioned·
nothing hut pure, unmingled wretchedness to any
human being. Were it not ior this, no child of
Adam could ever have contemplated God in any
other light, than that oi an inflexihly holy, just, and
offended Jndge, all whose perfectione demanded
his destruction. Were it notior this, there could
have been nothing before us, buta certain, fearsul
looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation. tt
is only when viewed through that Mediator, whom
the gospel reveals‚ that God can be contemplated
by sinsul creatores, without dismay and despair.
But in and through him God is reconciled. ln and
through him peace is offered to rebellione men;
through him we may all have accesr by one Spirit
unto the Father. Ο, then, be thanksul sor the gos-
pel of reconciliation, and show your gratitudo, by
aagerly embracing the terms os peace, which it'
proposes. Now, then, we are amhaesadors tor
Christ, as though God did heseech you hy ns: we
pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

4. ls sin alone the causa, which readers the re-
memhrance os God painsui? Then let all, who
have embraced the terms os reconciliation offered
hythe gospel, all who desire to remember God

without heing {publed heware, above all things, .
