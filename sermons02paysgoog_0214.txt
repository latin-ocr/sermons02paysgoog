mal seelings ol'· those, who are senctiliod, dier
irorn the s'arne seeliogs in those, who aro not.

The first thing, which l shall mention as belong·
ing to the anirnal soul,is that mutual affection,
which subsisto between parents and their children.
l consider this affection as belonging to the animal
soul, because irratioual animals evidently possess
ic While their ollspriug are iu a dependant state,
and need their care, thoy display an affection lor
them, at least as strong, ,as was ever exhibited by
human parents. They not only hazard, but ollon
lose their own lives indolending their young. And
their offspring no less evidently return their affec·
tion. We may add, thot the sorrow, which enirntds
leel, when deprived of their young, appears to be
as desp, though by no means so lasting, as thot
which parents seel sor the loss ol their children.¹
We have, therefore, l conceive, sufficient reason to
conclude that parente! and filial love, as it natur-
ally exists in mankind,is an affection, notos tbe
·immortel part or spirit, botos the animal sovrl,
though it is doubtlesr, in some measure, modified
and often regulatod by our rational soul. And
hence we further conclude, that these affections,
while they remain unsauctified by the Spirit os God,
or as they exist in men void ol' religion, bave notb-
ing in them ol a religione nature, nothing os moral
goodness or true boliness, nothing, which God is
under any obligation to accept or reward. No one
supposes, that there is any moral gooduess in the
affection, which animala feel sor their young. Anu
