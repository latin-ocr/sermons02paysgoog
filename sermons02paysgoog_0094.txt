per aud conduct, then you are walkiug in that way.

lf you leel unable 'to determine with certainty
what path you are pursuiug, permit me to mention
three things, which may essist you in determining
where you are. ln the first place, rememher there
are but two way's mentioned in scriptino, in one or
the other ol which every man is walking. One is
that which has now been described, the old and
broad way which wicked meu have trodden, and
which leads to destruction3 the other is the uur-
row, good old way, marked out by the Sonos God,
in which patriarche, prophete, apostles und mar·
tyrs bave walked, and which leads to lile. Now
since there are only these two ways, itis evideut,
that all who are. not walkiug in the latter are pureu-
ing the former. inquire theu whether you are in
the latter, the narrow path. lt is totally, and in
every respect, uulike the lonner. Those who

welk iu it are supremely influeuced, not by selfish· =

uess, but by that love which seeketh not her owu3·
not by pride, but by humility3 not by discontent,
but by constant acquiescence in the will os God.

lustead of indulging and secking to gratily their
λ appetitos and passione, they deny, mortisy, erucisy
them; instead os disbelieving God’s threatenings,
they believe thern, as well as his promises3 they
are heaveuly and not earthly minded, they con-
demn, instead os justisyiug themselves3 they rely
lor acceptauce and salvatiou, not on any work or
merite ol their own, but on the atouemeut aud·
