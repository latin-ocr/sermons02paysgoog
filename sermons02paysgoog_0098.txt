Ἰ isthe path os the openly irreligione. See close by

and mark out the path. Just within the gete =
stands an invisible guide, with extended hand ofler-
ing to lead, to assist, to support you; while attho

from which issue a flood ol glory‚ which you will

them. O, then, enter this path. Strive, strive to

, enter in at the straight gete-Will you reply,l

lrnow not what to do. l am in utter darkness. l
see not the gate, nor the way, nor the cross. Then

' cry earnestly lor light. Let yourheart be towards

the king’s highway, and light will soon shine upon
your steps. Above all, take not another step in
the satal roarl, which you have hitherto pursued.
Pass not this Sabbath, this warning way-mark, lest
you never see another.
