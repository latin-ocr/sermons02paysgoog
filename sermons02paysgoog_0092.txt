Romans. What calamities have since belallen the
Romish chureh, and successive generations os sin·
ners, l need not inform you. But if we would see
the final termination os this old way, wo must go
into the sanctuary ol God, and look through the
glass of revelation into eteruity. There we shall
see that this way leads dirootly down to the gates
ol hell. We are there taught, that the souls os
those, who were destroyed by the llood, are now
spirits in prison, the prison os God's wrath3 and
may, therefore, sairly inser, that the souls ol other
wiched rnen, who have since been cut down out os
time, are in the same situation. We are there told,
that there is no peace to the wicked; that destruc·
tion and rnisery are in their paths', that they are

, driven away in their wickedness; that they shall

go away into everlasting punishment. ln a word,
all the inspired writers cry with one voice, Woe Ι
unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him; sor the

reward os his hands shall be given him. ludeed,
it is evident froni the very nature os things, that
these declarations must botruo, that such a way ,
as we have described ean lead to nothing but end·

less misery.
