hear and be glad3 let his enemies hear and trem·
ble; he comes, our Princo, our Saviour, our De·
liverer comes, riding glorioualy in the chariot os

comes to do terrible things, and make bare hia om·

this rhajestio Prince, the King os glory, this illue·
trioua conqueror, should he visit you? Will you
meet him aa an enemy or aa a friend? Will you
lull under hie arrowe os conviction, or be blasted
by the lightnings cf his rengeance? Ales, at
present many os you can meet hi'm only aa ene·
mies. His mark ie not instamped on your lore-
headu, his protecting blood ie not sprinkled upon
the door poete os your horreos, to prevent the en·
nance of the destroying angel. There iano altar
lor prayer erected in your familiae, to distinguish
you from the heathen, who call not upon hie name,
and upon whom, we are told, hie sury will be
poured out. Nay, you have not even a seat at hie
table, to serve ae a visible token that you acknowl·
edge him for your friend. Soon will many of you
crowd away lrom him, though one would think
you should tremble lest he meet you at the door
and ask, why you thus fly srom the table ol your
Maker and Redeemer. But though now hie ene-
miee, it ie not too late to become hie sriende. One
great object, on which he goes lorth iu his chariot
ol salvadeu, is to convert his enemies into friends.
O, theu, seek to be found in this happy number.
Cry to him in all the anxiety ol nlarm, Lcrd, bend
